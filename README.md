# Impact of Severe Weather Events in Public Health and Economy

## Synopsis

Severe weather events can cause dramatic impact on health of the public and economy of the country. Thus, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database, which tracks the major storm and weather events, is used to address the following two questions:

1. Which types of events are most harmful to population health?
2. Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

Based on the dataset, which was recorded from 1950 to November, 2011, the result are as follows:

* __TORNADO__ is the most harmful weather event in regards to population health.
* __FLOOD__ causes the most property damage, while __DROUGHT__ causes the highest crop damage.
